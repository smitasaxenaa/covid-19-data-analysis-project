# COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python

This project involves preprocessing and merging 2 datasets to calculate the needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. 
The project involves 2 datasets -
1. COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. 
2. World Happiness Report which consists of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  
The project aims at merging these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
